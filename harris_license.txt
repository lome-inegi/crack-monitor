Customized from:
% HARRIS - Harris corner detector
%
% Usage: cim = harris(im, sigma)
% [cim, r, c] = harris(im, sigma, thresh, radius, disp)
% [cim, r, c, rsubp, csubp] = harris(im, sigma, thresh, radius, disp)
%
% Arguments:
% im - image to be processed.
% sigma - standard deviation of smoothing Gaussian. Typical
% values to use might be 1-3.
% thresh - threshold (optional). Try a value ~1000.
% radius - radius of region considered in non-maximal
% suppression (optional). Typical values to use might
% be 1-3.
% disp - optional flag (0 or 1) indicating whether you want
% to display corners overlayed on the original
% image. This can be useful for parameter tuning. This
% defaults to 0
%
% Returns:
% cim - binary image marking corners.
% r - row coordinates of corner points.
% c - column coordinates of corner points.
% rsubp - If five return values are requested sub-pixel
% csubp - localization of feature points is attempted and
% returned as an additional set of floating point
% coords. Note that you may still want to use the integer
% valued coords to specify centres of correlation windows
% for feature matching.
%
% If thresh and radius are omitted from the argument list only 'cim' is returned
% as a raw corner strength image. You may then want to look at the values
% within 'cim' to determine the appropriate threshold value to use. Note that
% the Harris corner strength varies with the intensity gradient raised to the
% 4th power. Small changes in input image contrast result in huge changes in
% the appropriate threshold.
